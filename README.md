# Project 2: Shell Builtins

## Description

For this project, you will have to clone the entire repository. You will then navigate to the folder on your local computer using the change directory, then you utilize Go Build, and finally, you will be left with an executable application.  

An example of how to run the program (assuming you have already downloaded it to your computer) (actions separated by commas):
cd CSCE4600P2,
go build,
.\CSCE4600P2.exe,
touch hello.html,
